You wake up in a dark room, along one of the rooms walls is a porthole window.
You look out the window to see that you are far under the surface of the water. 
You see a very faint light far above you. You continue to look around the room and see the faint outline of a door. You begin walking towards it.
As you aproach the door you see a wheel that you need to turn to open the door.
The door opens and you step out, As you walk through the brightly lit steel halls, you think you might be in a primative submarine.
You continue to walk through this submarine and you find the kitchen, but there isno one in there so you keep moving.
Then you find the control room, with many instruments that you are uncertain of what they do, you also find in the middle of the room is a periscope.
You walk towards it and look through the lens. You swear you see something move you continue moving the scope to see what you saw, but you continue turning it and find nothing. 
So you go to walk away then before you do you see what had moved in your field of veiw...
